Since version v1.20 the level editor is completely independent of the UI implementation. You do not need to use any rigid UI extension system. Simply add the needed UI to the scene. To extend the help popup of the built-in example UI add your help UI to the help popup's page root 'ImageRect' (search for it). Then duplicate the 'Touch-Screen' toggle button (search for 'ToggleTouch'), rearrange it, update its text and change its 'OnValueChanged(bool)' function to activate the UI that you have added to the popup. If you want to use a custom UI, then you can find more information in <a href="custom-ui.html">this article</a>.<br />
